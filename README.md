# Backupify
Create a duplicate of your Spotify playlists, easily both from Node.JS or a web interface.
## Web interface

Try it: https://dinoosauro.github.io/Backupify/

The Web Interface is an easy way to manage your playlists. After logging in with Spotify API, you'll be able to choose with a checkbox which playlist(s) to backup.

## Command-line tool
You can run Backupify also from the command line, using Node.JS. Make sure to add your own Client ID in the ```console.js``` file. The script will automatically create a server on localhost, that'll be used for authenticating with Spotify API. Make sure to add ```http://localhost:15200/next.html``` as the Redirect URI in your Spotify console.
### Passing playlist with playlist.json
You can choose the playlists to duplicate by creating a ```playlist.json``` file. This JSON will need to contain the playlist ID as a key, and the name of the duplicate playlist as a value. For example
```
{
  "37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M": "Today's Top Hits",
  "37i9dQZF1DX4JAvHpjipBk": "New Music Friday"
}
```
### Passing playlist directly from the script
If you don't have a ```playlist.json``` file, the script will use the ```playlist```Â object the ```clientOptions``` variable. You can add there playlist IDs and names by following the same syntax as a JSON file.

## Privacy
Everything is done in your browser. The only connections made from Backupify are to Google Fonts, for displaying the 'Work Sans' font, and to Spotify, to get, create and add items to the playlists.
